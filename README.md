# I use Rust BTW 🦀

Small commands that don't deserve their own repo. They probably should be bash 
scripts, but I decided to rewrite my scripts in Rust! (or at least write new
ones in Rust).  
I did it for few reasons:

  - For the memes  🥳
  - So they are blazingly fast  🚤
  - For the memes  🍰
  - To learn Rust  🦀
  - And for the memes of course  🎊

Also, my small bash scripts are sometimes growing too much 😕
